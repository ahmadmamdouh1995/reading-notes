### Clearing Floats:
* left :The left-hand side of the box should not touch any other elements appearing in the same containing element.

### The following three CSS properties are used to position the columns next to each other :
* width : This sets the width of the columns
* float : This positions the columns next to each other
* margin : This creates a gap between the columns.

### Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch.
#### Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide .

### Benefits of Grids :
* Creates a continuity between different pages which may use different designs
* Helps users predict where to find information on various pages
* Makes it easier to add new content to the site in a consistent way
* Helps people collaborate on the design of a site in a consistent way

### To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use box offset :
* Fixed Positioning :This is a form of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window.
* Floating Elements :Floating an element allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box.


#### Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

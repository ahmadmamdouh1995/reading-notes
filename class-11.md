## Images
### You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.
### There are two ways ti algin images :
* New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page.
* The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image.

### There are two common ways in which you can horizontally center an image:
* On the containing element,you can use the text-align property with a value of center.
* On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.

### The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element.

### Repeating Images:
* repeat :The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically
* repeat-x :The image is repeated horizontally only
* repeat-y :The image is repeated vertically only
* no-repeat :The image is only shown once
* fixed :The background image stays in the same position on the page.
* scroll :The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.


### When an image is not being repeated, you can use the background-position property to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed.
* left top
* left center
* left bottom
* center top
* center center
* center bottom
* right top
* right center
* right bottom

### The properties must be specified in the following order, but you can miss any value if you do not want to specify it.
1. background-color
2. background-image
3. background-repeat
4. background-attachment
5. background-position

### Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.
### You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.
### To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.

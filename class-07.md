## Tables :
#### A table represents information in a grid format.
* The "table" element is used to add tables to a web page.
* A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the "tr" element.
* Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the "td" element (or "th" if it is a header).
* You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
* For long tables you can split the table into a 'thead','tbody', and 'tfoot'.


 ### A METHOD OF AN OBJECT:
 #### When a function is defined inside an object, it becomes a method. In a method, this refers to the containing object.


 ### FUNCTION EXPRESSION AS METHOD:
 #### If a named function has been defined in global scope, and it is then used as a method of an object, this refers to the object it is contained within.

 ### In JavaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs:
 * VARIABLES :A variable has just one key (the variable name) and one value.
 * ARRAYS :Arrays can store multiple pieces of information.

 ### Objects type :
 * INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS :Objects store sets of name/value pairs.
 * MULTIPLE OBJECTS :When you need to create multiple objects within the same page.

 ### SIMPLE OR PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES :
 1. String
 2. Number
 3. Boolean
 4. Undefined 
 5. Null
 6. 0bject

### some proparites of Functions :
* Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.
* Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value.
* An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.
* In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.
* Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.
* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
* Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).

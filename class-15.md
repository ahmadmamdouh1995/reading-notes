## The key characteristics of ‘enhanced teams’ After years of analyzing data and interviews from more than 180 teams across the company, Google found that the kinds of people (a.k.a. the individual personalities) in a team are not so relevant.

“We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The ‘who’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter,” Dubey said in an interview with The New York Times.
Instead, the researchers found that there were five key characteristics of enhanced teams:

* Psychological safety: Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won’t be embarrassed or punished for doing so.
* Dependability: Everyone completes quality work on time.
* Structure and clarity: Everyone knows what their specific expectations are. These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.
* Meaning: Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).
* Impact: Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization’s overall goals

### Left brained vs. right brained personalities
A simple way to look at this is through the “left brain vs. right brain” theory, which goes that everyone has a dominant side of the brain (the right or the left), and it determines their personality, thoughts and behavior.

### Why pragmatism is a rarely desired trait
Employees in the medical field might not need a strong degree of creativity (a.k.a. those right brained personalities). But across the board in every business and industry, when teams come together, EQ (emotional intelligence) matters much more than IQ (intelligence quotient).
